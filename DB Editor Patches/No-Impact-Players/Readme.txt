Removal of Impact Players by Antdroid

This is a file you could test if you want. You need to use MXDBE, go to TEAM, right click on any table header, press ADDENDUM, then choose this file.

How it works:

What it does is sets the 3 impact player slots on each team to player ID of 70, which doesnt exist on the team (as its only 0-69). The game wont be able to find the impact players then. 

Of course, the game recalculates impact players at the beginning of each year, so this would need to be re-performed in pre-season and potentially mid-season when a 3rd impact player is added to the game.

NCAA 06 NEXT FULL GAME MODIFICATIONS

These are FULL GAME ISO patches for testing. They replace the files in your existing ISO/Disc.

INSTALLATION

To start, you will need to download an Disc Burning tool. I prefer this free software called ImgBurn.

https://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download

To avoid possible adware, use the Softpedia mirror link for downloading.





1) Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. This will create a new virtual drive.

2) Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like.

3) Copy the entire contents of your ISO into the "NCAA06" folder created in Step 2.

4) Choose one of the NCAA 06 NEXT ISO Packages and UNZIP the contents into the "NCAA06" folder. This will ask you to override existing files. Click Yes.

5) In the "NCAA06" folder, there will be a file called Install.bat (or just Install). Double-click to run it. This will delete 3 files from your NCAA06 DATA folder: FE.QKL , GAME.QKL, PL.QKL



6. Now open ImgBurn.

7. Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side.

8. On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the "NCAA06" root folder.

9. Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

10. Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO, and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

11. Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!

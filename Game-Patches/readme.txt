NCAA 06 Football Patches by Antdroid

This is a collection of separate patches that can possibly be combined to change different aspects of the base game disc.

You can combine and install these patches at the same time as long as they are compatible. As such, you can, and should, create separate iso files for each mod version you want! :)


2021-Road-to-Heisman:
This patches the game to include 2021 season rosters for all teams and includes historic named rosters. This allows the game to also work with Road-to-Heisman mode with 21 rosters correctly. This is NOT compatible with the Dynasty Mod. That mod already has these features built-in but is exclusively designed for the Dynasty Save starter file. 

Uniform Patch:
This patch includes updates to the number and helmet number/letter design locations that can not be updated by textures only. This updates the locations for the modern uniforms. This should be compatible with all other patches.

Dynasty Mod:
This mod updates the game with 2021 rosters, and updates the schedule generation templates to create new realigned conference structure exclusively for the Dynasty Save starter file. Do not create a new Dynasty with this patch. It will not work correctly and may crash. This is compatible with other mods, but not with the 2021-Road-to-Heisman patch, since they replace the same file.

All-State Patch
This patch updates the Pontiac Drive Summary text to say All-State Drive Recap to go with the All-State sponsorship update. They are the official sponsor of NCAA Field Goals. This patch will work with all combinations of patches.

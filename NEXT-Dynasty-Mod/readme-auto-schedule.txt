NCAA Football 06 - NEXT
Dynasty Modification for 2021 Season

This method creates a modified NCAA 06 Football ISO file for using this specific Dynasty Mod.



To start, you will need to download an Disc Burning tool. I prefer this free software called ImgBurn.

https://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download


1. Find your NCAA 06 ISO file and double click it in Windows. This will create a new virtual drive.

2. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer, and call it "NCAA06" or whatever you like.

3. Open the new Virtual Disc drive. Copy the entire contents into the NCAA06 folder created in Step 2.

4. In the same directory as this readme file, go to the Auto Method folder, and open the ISO-PATCH folder.

5. Copy the contents (i.e. DATA and its sub-directories) into the "NCAA06" folder. This will override the existing Template.dat file.

6. Now open ImgBurn.

7. Click CREATE IMAGE FROM FILES/FOLDERS on the middle-right side.

8. On the left hand side, click the folder search icon ("Browse for a Folder") and select the NCAA06 root folder.

9. Click the Create ISO icon at the bottom left. Its the icon that looks like a folder pointing to a CD image.

10. Click through the prompts, choose a name for the ISO, and wait for the app to create a new ISO file.

11. Now you can start PCSX2 with the new ISO created!


In-Game Setup Instructions:

Install the dynasty save file, by using MyMC to install the NCAA-NEXT-DYNASTY.psu into the desired memory card, if you are not using the default Memory Card included in NEXT.

1. Load up the dynasty save file (2021dyn).

2. Go to COACH OPTIONS. Go to POSITIONS.

3. If you do not want to be UMass, press CIRCLE to create a new Coach and team. Then highlight UMass and press X to quit was UMass.


The first season is all setup with a working schedule, new rosters, depth charts, playbook and coaching changes, as well as magazine covers, and Heisman candidates.

Play as you normally would throughout the entire season!

This patched ISO you created will automatically generate season schedules automatically!


Hooray!

1. Open Any Burn, and choose EDIT IMAGE FILE

4. Press ADD at the top, and locate the Template.dat file in the NCAA NEXT folder. This Template.dat is located in /NEXT-DYNASTY-MOD/Auto Method/. Add this Template.dat file, and choose YES to override the existing file.

6. Press CREATE and let it do its magic.

7. In PCSX2, load this newly created ISO image when using the Dynasty Mod saves.


In-Game Setup Instructions:

Install the dynasty save file, by using MyMC to install the NCAA-NEXT-DYNASTY.max into the desired memory card, if you are not using the default Memory Card included in NEXT.

1. Load up the dynasty save file (2021dyn).

2. Go to COACH OPTIONS. Go to POSITIONS.

3. If you do not want to be UMass, press CIRCLE to create a new Coach and team. Then highlight UMass and press X to quit was UMass.


The first season is all setup with a working schedule, new rosters, depth charts, playbook and coaching changes, as well as magazine covers, and Heisman candidates.

Play as you normally would throughout the entire season!

This patched ISO you created will automatically generate season schedules automatically!


Hooray!

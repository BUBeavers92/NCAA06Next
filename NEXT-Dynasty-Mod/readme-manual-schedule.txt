NCAA Football 06 - NEXT
Dynasty Modification for 2021 Season


Instructions:

Install the dynasty save file, by using MyMC to install the NCAA-NEXT-DYNASTY.max into the desired memory card, if you are not using the default Memory Card included in NEXT.

1. Load up the dynasty save file (2021dyn).

2. Go to COACH OPTIONS. Go to POSITIONS.

3. If you do not want to be Kalean DeBoer/Washington, press CIRCLE to create a new Coach and team. Then highlight Washington and press X to quit was Washington.


The first season is all setup with a working schedule, new rosters, depth charts, playbook and coaching changes, as well as magazine covers, and Heisman candidates.


Play as you normally would throughout the entire season!


After you finish the off-season and the game generates a new schedule, you'll need to make a save point at the beginning of the following year.


At this point, you will need to extract the save file by the following:


1. Open MyMC and open your Memory Card.

2. Export the Dynasty save.

3. Use PS2 Save Builder to open the save and export the Dyn file.

4. Open this Dyn file in Madden X DB Editor.

5. Find the SCHD Table and Export to CSV.

Now you will need the NCAA 06 Schedule Generator tool by RobotDebris.

After you extract this tool's contents to a folder, go to the "Scheduler Files" folder in this directory. Drop those files into the Scheduler folder. This will replace the School_Data.xlsx file with a new one with updated rivalries for this dynasty. A backup is included. It will also have a premade Conference Alignment file called NCAA-NEXT.xlsx.


You can now use the Scheduler with the exported SCHD file from above, and the NCAA-NEX alignment file.


When you create a new schedule, remove all OOC games first. Then go conference by conference and add Conf Games first for all FBS conferences. Then go back to main tab and press Auto-Fill Schedule.


Save the file and reimport that into SCHD table of the Dyn save file.


Now you are ready to reload the save file back into your Memory card by creating a new MAX file with PS2 Save Builder, and then reimporting this into Mem card using MyMC.

Hooray!

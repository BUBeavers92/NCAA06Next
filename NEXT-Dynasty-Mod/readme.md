This dynasty mod does require some manual modifications. 

The first and preferred method requires an upfront manual creation of a new NCAA 06 ISO file. The instructions are in <a href="readme-auto-schedule.txt">readme-auto-schedule.txt</a>. 

The alternative method is easier upfront, but requires manual file manipulation at the end of each season. The instructions for this are in <a href="readme-manual-schedule.txt">readme-manual-schedule.txt</a>

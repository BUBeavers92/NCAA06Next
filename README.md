### You will need

Please obtain at least this version of pcsx2 or higher:

https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/releases/tag/v1.7.2389

### How to install

Take the attached zip and unzip its contents directly into your pcsx2 folder.

Please do NOT extract it into a folder of the same name as the zip, just put the contents (a textures folder) directly into your pcsx2 folder!

For rosters, you may get a .ps2 memory card file for pcsx2 courtesy of operation sports here:

### How to use alternates

In your PCSX2 folder , navigate to 'textures/SLUS-21214/alternate_replacements'. In this folder you can find alternates by conference.  Take a 'home' or 'away' folder from one of these and replace the home and away in the actual 'replacements' folder.  You may want to keep the archive around or backup your replacements folder so you can switch back.

### No interlacing/auto widescreen

I mispoke when I refered to this patch as 'my patch' - it is a patch from https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-No-interlacing-codes?page=41 all credit to the author.
I was remembering a patch I ported for another madden game - but now the forum link has a bunch of patches including this one.

I copied it here:

https://github.com/h4wduk3n/NCAA06Next/tree/main/no_interlacing_auto_widescreen_patch

To use this patch, place it in your pcsx2 'cheats' folder, make sure cheats are enabled in pcsx2.  In 'general' settings of pcsx2 set your display aspect to 16:9 and zoom to '0'. Finally, set deinterlacing to 'none' in GS settings.  This is what worked best for me.

### Current status:

Uniform updates (Done doesn't mean we wont keep adding stuff :)):

BIG10 - Done

PAC12 - Done

SEC - Done

Other conferences - In Progress (details to come after SEC release)

### Roster updates:

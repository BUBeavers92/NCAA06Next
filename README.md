### You will need

Please obtain at least this version of pcsx2 or higher:

https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/releases/tag/v1.7.2389

### How to install

Take the attached zip and unzip its contents directly into your pcsx2 folder.

Please do NOT extract it into a folder of the same name as the zip, just put the contents (a textures folder) directly into your pcsx2 folder!

### How to use alternates

In your PCSX2 folder , navigate to 'textures/SLUS-21214/alternate_replacements'. In this folder you can find alternates by conference.  Take a 'home' or 'away' folder from one of these and replace the home and away in the actual 'replacements' folder.  You may want to keep the archive around or backup your replacements folder so you can switch back.

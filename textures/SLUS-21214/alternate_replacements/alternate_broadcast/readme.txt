Broadcast Logos



Icons Folder
This changes some of the broadcast icons like:
Triangle replaces Football possession sign or Brown Football possession
Timeouts Remaining replaced with bars
Removed Pontiac sponsorships, replaced with All-State and Coca Cola and AT&T


Pick one of the two options for Channel Logo:

Animated Circle-Logos Folder
This folder contains logos that work with the animated circle, i.e. direct replacement of the EA Sports logo.

Static-Logos Folder
This removes the animated circle and replaces with static image logos


Instructions:

Move icons folder to Replacements/Broadcast folder. Only choose one of the possession arrow folders.

Pick channel logo you prefer, and move to Replacement/Broadcast folder.
Remove existing file if it does not get overrided: e58694e24ea70458-1d314fae9d093a9a-00005993.png



Advanced Users:
SLUS_212.14 contains the fix to change the Pontiac branding to All-State. It will need to be added to the Disc/ISO and replace the existing file on the root folder.
